**Comparison of Logistic Regression Model and Log Linear Model applied to Titanic Survival data**


Titanic Survival data provides information about passengers who survived from Titanic. The data set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal voyage of the ocean liner “Titanic“. It contains variables including economic status, sex, age and survival status of passengers. Using the information about characteristics of the passengers, I would like to create statistical models that can predict the survival status. I would like to preprocess the data and apply logistic regression model and then log linear model. I would compare the performance of logistic regression models so that I could select the most appropriate model. Also, I would like to illustrate the mosaic plots of loglinear models to check the degrees of association between variables.
